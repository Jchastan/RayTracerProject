4. Still not entirely sure what you mean by this. The project was built in windows using the hw1 solution
so there shouldn't be any out of the ordinary compilation requirements. Be warened, I personally (not Xavier) messed up which is why my, possibly our, solution code doesn't
produce the images that we submitted.
