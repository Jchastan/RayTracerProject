# Raytracer project
This is a project that I completed for an assignment originally using Nvidia's Optix api. Various fidelity-related features are implemented in disableable settings in the scene files which can be edited to change what features/methods are used to render or optimize the rendering of the scenes, including anti-aliasing, next event estimation, multiple importance sampling, and russian roulette consolidation, and use of some built-in optimization functionality.
## Raytracing demos:
